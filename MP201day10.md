The group project went quite well. Also, doing a bit of HTML and CSS was a good break from JavaScript. Going over what we had been learning was good practice. The practice was also fun, I enjoy the design aspect of building webpages. Richard and I where able to complete the lab(at least most of it anyways) by 5. This was the best possible timing for the both of us because we both had to leave in order to prepare to drive back to our families.
