Continued in DOM today. While unable to finish todays lab work, I was able to place my functions, loops, arrays, etc, in the constructor. I am almost done with the table I think. Also I talked to Aaron about my progress in the class. We discussed where I am currently at in that class and what can be done to help me stay afloat and progress. Thanks Aaron.
