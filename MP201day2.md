Today was much more challenging than yesterday. I understood the HTML and CSS alright. However, when I had to go through the JavaScript parts of our projects I struggled through. It looks like I am going to have to put a lot of extra work into understanding JavaScript in my personal time. It was also difficult working through some of the git commands and practices. I couldn't find any much information in our class instructions for walking us through all the git procedures. I may be looking in the wrong places. At any rate, I still have some work to do to catch up with the rest of the class.
