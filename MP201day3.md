Today was quite the struggle through JavaScript. As usual, HTML and CSS where not too difficult, with a bit of google searches I was able to find solutions to the problems I encountered with those languages. However I  simply could not find anything online that would adequately explain how to use while loop and Arrays. I am also finishing yesterdays work today(11/10) at about 6am because I could not figure out yesterdays material after going home and trying. Ill have to try to figure out how to stay afloat in class. Im determined to understand the material and pass the class. We will see if my work pays off.
