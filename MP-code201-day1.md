Today there was a lot of review which was quite helpful. There was also a bit which I have not seen yet. I learned very quickly that I am going to learn how to type faster and with more precision, it looks like its going to be easy to fall behind in the lesson if you make a grammatical error or don't understand a particular concept right away. I will also have to do extra work on my own reviewing some of the more basic principles in JavaScript. When going covering HTML and CSS concepts I was able to recall them right away. But it was much more difficult trying to keep up with JavaScript.
